# Find the Mountain Goat

A modern, single-page web app built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project was created to showcase my ability to rapidly recreate and emulate the  design language and styles used on Remark's company website.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

I built this project as a creative demonstration for my application to Remark. My goal was to prove my frontend skills by replicating their signature Webflow-based styles and layouts from scratch, using a modern React/Next.js stack instead of no-code tools.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## ✨ Features
- Responsive, accessible layout
- Custom modal and interactive elements
- Styles and UI patterns inspired by Remark's public website
- Built in a single night to demonstrate rapid prototyping and design implementation skills
- One Mountain Goat

## 🖥️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/findthemountaingoat.git
   cd findthemountaingoat
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
4. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

## 📄 Motivation
> I built this page overnight as a challenge to myself and as a portfolio piece for my job application to Remark. My aim was to show that I can easily match the design and interactivity of Webflow-driven sites using a modern code stack.
